# Operating System Concepts: CPU Scheduling & Deadlocks

## 1. Introduction to CPU Scheduling Algorithms

CPU Scheduling is a fundamental process by which the operating system decides which process in the ready queue should be allocated to the CPU for execution. The main goal of CPU scheduling algorithms is to maximize CPU utilization, throughput, and minimize waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.

### Key Metrics

* **Arrival Time (AT):** The time at which a process arrives in the ready queue.
* **Burst Time (BT):** The total CPU time required by a process to execute.
* **Completion Time (CT):** The time at which a process finishes execution.
* **Turnaround Time (TAT):** Total time spent from arrival to completion.

$$\mathrm{TAT} = \mathrm{CT} - \mathrm{AT}$$

* **Waiting Time (WT):** Total time spent waiting in the ready queue before getting CPU allocation.

$$\mathrm{WT} = \mathrm{TAT} - \mathrm{BT}$$

### How Common CPU Scheduling Algorithms Work

#### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
* **Type:** Non-preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Processes are dispatched in the exact order they arrive in the ready queue (FIFO queue). The process that requests the CPU first gets allocated the CPU first.
* **Pros/Cons:** Simple to understand and implement. However, it can suffer from the **Convoy Effect**, where short processes wait behind long processes, leading to high average waiting times.

#### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
* **Type:** Non-preemptive / Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)
* **Mechanism:** Selects the process with the smallest Burst Time (BT) from the ready queue.
* **Pros/Cons:** Provides the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes. However, predicting the exact CPU burst time in advance is difficult in real operating systems, and long processes can face **starvation**.

#### 3. Priority Scheduling
* **Type:** Preemptive or Non-preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Each process is assigned a priority integer value. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority (e.g., lowest numerical value often represents highest priority).
* **Pros/Cons:** Useful for real-time systems where certain tasks are critical. Major disadvantage is **starvation** (low-priority tasks may wait indefinitely), which can be resolved using **Aging** (gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait for a long time).

#### 4. Round Robin (RR)
* **Type:** Preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Designed for time-sharing systems. Each process is assigned a fixed unit of CPU time called a **Time Quantum** or **Time Slice**. Processes are executed in a cyclic order. If a process does not complete within its assigned quantum, it is preempted and put at the tail of the ready queue.
* **Pros/Cons:** Very responsive and fair. Performance heavily depends on the size of the time quantum—too large acts like FCFS, and too small increases context-switching overhead.

## 2. FCFS Scheduling Algorithm Implementation

Below is a complete C++ implementation of the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Process {
public:
    int pid, at, bt;
    int ct, tat, wt;
    Process(int id, int arrival, int burst) {
        pid = id;
        at = arrival;
        bt = burst;
        ct = 0;
        tat = 0;
        wt = 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    Process p[] = {
        Process(1, 0, 7),
        Process(2, 2, 4),
        Process(3, 4, 1),
        Process(4, 5, 4),
        Process(5, 6, 3)
    };
    int n = 5;

    // Sort processes based on arrival time
    sort(p, p + n, [](Process a, Process b) {
        return a.at < b.at;
    });

    int time = 0;
    float totalWT = 0;
    float totalTAT = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (time < p[i].at)
            time = p[i].at;
        time += p[i].bt;
        p[i].ct = time;
        p[i].tat = p[i].ct - p[i].at;
        p[i].wt = p[i].tat - p[i].bt;
        totalWT += p[i].wt;
        totalTAT += p[i].tat;
    }

    cout << "PID\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "P" << p[i].pid << "\t"
             << p[i].at << "\t"
             << p[i].bt << "\t"
             << p[i].ct << "\t"
             << p[i].tat << "\t"
             << p[i].wt << endl;
    }

    cout << "\nAverage Waiting Time = " << totalWT / n;
    cout << "\nAverage Turnaround Time = " << totalTAT / n << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 3. Introduction to Deadlocks

A **Deadlock** is a situation in a multi-tasking environment where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that is being held by another waiting process.

### Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

A deadlock can occur if and only if all four of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system:

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode (only one process can use the resource at a time).
2. **Hold and Wait:** A process must be currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources that are being held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they can only be released voluntarily after the process completes its task.
4. **Circular Wait:** A closed chain of processes exists such that each process holds one or more resources needed by the next process in the chain.

### How Banker's Algorithm Works

The **Banker's Algorithm** is a deadlock avoidance and detection algorithm named after its analogy to a bank manager serving customers. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation of the maximum declared resources, checking if the system remains in a **Safe State**.

#### Key Matrices and Arrays

* **Allocation Matrix ($n \times m$):** Defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.
* **Max Matrix ($n \times m$):** Defines the maximum demand of each resource by each process.
* **Need Matrix ($n \times m$):** Represents the remaining resource needs of each process.

$$\mathrm{Need}[i][j] = \mathrm{Max}[i][j] - \mathrm{Allocation}[i][j]$$

* **Available Array ($m$):** Vector of length $m$ indicating the number of available resources of each type.
