## 🔍 Part 1: Command Reference Guide

Use this table to look up fundamental Linux commands, their required syntax, and a description of what they do.

| 💻 Command | 📁 Syntax / Arguments | ℹ️ Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`hostname`** | *None* | Displays the name of the machine. Each machine on the network is given a unique name by the system administrator. |
| **`date`** | *None* | Displays the current date and time. |
| **`pwd`** | *None* | Print (on the screen) the pathname of the working directory (i.e. the directory you are presently in). |
| **`ls`** | *None* | List contents of directories. |
| **`ls -p`** | *None* | List directory and put a slash (/) after each entry that is a directory name. |
| **`cd`** | `<FolderName>` | Change working directory to FolderName. |
| **`cd ..`** | *None* | Change to the directory one level up (as specified by the use of two dots). |
| **`cd`** | *None* | Change to your home directory. |
| **`cd ../../..`** | *None* | Change to the directory three levels up (as specified by the use of two dots that is used 3 times separated by a slash (/)). |
| **`cd /`** | *None* | Change to the top most level directory (i.e. the root directory). |
| **`mkdir`** | `<FolderName>` | Make a directory named FolderName. |
| **`mkdir`** | `<FolderName1/FolderName2>` | Create a directory named FolderName2 underneath the one named FolderName1. |
| **`rmdir`** | `<FolderName>` | Remove an empty directory called FolderName. |
| **`rm -r`** | `<FolderName>` | Remove the folder named FolderName that is not empty. |
| **`mv`** | `<OldFolderName> <NewFolderName>` | Rename the directory named from OldFolderName to NewFolderName. |
| **`mv`** | `<FolderName1> <FolderName2>` | Move the directory FolderName1 to FolderName2. |
| **`cp -r`** | `<FolderName1> <FolderName2>` | Copy the directory FolderName1 into FolderName2. |
| **`cp`** | `<FileName> <FolderName>` | Copy the file FileName into FolderName. |
| **`touch`** | `<FileName>` | Create a new file named FileName. |
| **`cat`** | `<FileName>` | A way of displaying the contents of a text file named FileName. |

## 🛠️ Part 2: Practice Session for Students

> 💡 **Student Tip:** Try typing these commands exactly as shown into your terminal. You can track your progress by following along step-by-step.

---

### 🟢 Phase 1: Basic Navigation & Directory Creation

**Step 1:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory. (The directory you are automatically placed in after logging on is referred to as your 'home' directory.)

**Step 2:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current directory (should be empty at this stage).

**Step 3:** Run `mkdir testdir`
> *Task:* Make a subdirectory named 'testdir'.

**Step 4:** Run `cd testdir`
> *Task:* Change directory to the new directory.

**Step 5:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory.

**Step 6:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current working directory (should be empty at this stage).

---

### 🟡 Phase 2: Returning Home & Exploring the Root System

**Step 7:** Run `cd`
> *Task:* The change directory command, `cd`, on its own will move you back to your 'home directory'. Another way to return to your home directory is to use the command `cd ~`.

**Step 8:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory (it should be your home directory).

**Step 9:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current directory (this should now show the name of the subdirectory named `testdir`).

**Step 10:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd /
pwd
ls
ls -p
```
> *Task:* Change to the top most level directory (i.e. the root directory). Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory. List the contents of the current directory and put a forward slash at the end of any entry that is a directory.

**Step 11: System Check**
> *Task:* Check that the names of the directories under the root directory agree with those listed in the theory page. If not, make a note of any differences.

---

### 🔵 Phase 3: Relative Paths & File Operations

**Step 12:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Change to your home directory. Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 13:** Run `cd testdir`
> *Task:* Change to the directory named `testdir`.

**Step 14:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd ..
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Change to the directory one level up (as specified by the use of two dots). Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 15: Complex Sequence Challenge**
Execute these commands step-by-step to practice active management:
```bash
pwd 
ls
mkdir testdir/play 
ls
cd testdir/play 
pwd
ls
cd .. 
pwd 
ls
mv play play2 
ls
```
> *Task Walkthrough:*
> 1. Check you are in your home directory.
> 2. List the contents of the current directory.
> 3. Create a directory named `play` underneath the one named `testdir`.
> 4. List the contents of the current directory.
> 5. Change directory into the one just created.
> 6. Confirm where you are.
> 7. List the contents of the current directory.
> 8. Change up one level (i.e. back up to the `testdir` directory) and confirm where you are.
> 9. List the contents of the current directory.
> 10. Rename the directory named `play` to `play2`.
> 11. List the contents of the current directory to check that the renaming has been done.

> 📖 **Note (Step 16):** The command `cd testdir/play` uses the name of the directory relative to the current directory. To be more precise you could have specified the command as `cd ./testdir/play` where the single dot means the current directory.

### 🔴 Phase 4: Cleaning Up & Resetting

**Step 17:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Move back up to your home directory. Confirm where you are. List the contents of the current working directory.

**Step 18:** Run `rmdir testdir`
> *Task:* Remove directory. You will find that this command will not work since the directory contains subdirectories. Overcome this by first removing the lower level directories. (Later you will be shown a potentially dangerous command that will remove any directory and anything underneath it.)

**Step 19:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Check where you are. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 20:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
mkdir testdir
mkdir testdir/play
```
> *Task:* Recreate the directories again to restore your workspace.
