## 🛠️ Part 2: Practice Session for Students

> 💡 **Student Tip:** Try typing these commands exactly as shown into your terminal. You can track your progress by following along step-by-step.

---

### 🟢 Phase 1: Basic Navigation & Directory Creation

**Step 1:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory. (The directory you are automatically placed in after logging on is referred to as your 'home' directory.)

**Step 2:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current directory (should be empty at this stage).

**Step 3:** Run `mkdir testdir`
> *Task:* Make a subdirectory named 'testdir'.

**Step 4:** Run `cd testdir`
> *Task:* Change directory to the new directory.

**Step 5:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory.

**Step 6:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current working directory (should be empty at this stage).

---

### 🟡 Phase 2: Returning Home & Exploring the Root System

**Step 7:** Run `cd`
> *Task:* The change directory command, `cd`, on its own will move you back to your 'home directory'. Another way to return to your home directory is to use the command `cd ~`.

**Step 8:** Run `pwd`
> *Task:* Write down the pathname of your current directory (it should be your home directory).

**Step 9:** Run `ls`
> *Task:* List the contents of your current directory (this should now show the name of the subdirectory named `testdir`).

**Step 10:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd /
pwd
ls
ls -p
```
> *Task:* Change to the top most level directory (i.e. the root directory). Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory. List the contents of the current directory and put a forward slash at the end of any entry that is a directory.

**Step 11: System Check**
> *Task:* Check that the names of the directories under the root directory agree with those listed in the theory page. If not, make a note of any differences.

---

### 🔵 Phase 3: Relative Paths & File Operations

**Step 12:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Change to your home directory. Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 13:** Run `cd testdir`
> *Task:* Change to the directory named `testdir`.

**Step 14:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd ..
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Change to the directory one level up (as specified by the use of two dots). Confirm where you are using the `pwd` command. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 15: Complex Sequence Challenge**
Execute these commands step-by-step to practice active management:
```bash
pwd 
ls
mkdir testdir/play 
ls
cd testdir/play 
pwd
ls
cd .. 
pwd 
ls
mv play play2 
ls
```
> *Task Walkthrough:*
> 1. Check you are in your home directory.
> 2. List the contents of the current directory.
> 3. Create a directory named `play` underneath the one named `testdir`.
> 4. List the contents of the current directory.
> 5. Change directory into the one just created.
> 6. Confirm where you are.
> 7. List the contents of the current directory.
> 8. Change up one level (i.e. back up to the `testdir` directory) and confirm where you are.
> 9. List the contents of the current directory.
> 10. Rename the directory named `play` to `play2`.
> 11. List the contents of the current directory to check that the renaming has been done.

> 📖 **Note (Step 16):** The command `cd testdir/play` uses the name of the directory relative to the current directory. To be more precise you could have specified the command as `cd ./testdir/play` where the single dot means the current directory.

---

### 🔴 Phase 4: Cleaning Up & Resetting

**Step 17:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Move back up to your home directory. Confirm where you are. List the contents of the current working directory.

**Step 18:** Run `rmdir testdir`
> *Task:* Remove directory. You will find that this command will not work since the directory contains subdirectories. Overcome this by first removing the lower level directories. (Later you will be shown a potentially dangerous command that will remove any directory and anything underneath it.)

**Step 19:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
pwd
ls
```
> *Task:* Check where you are. List the contents of the current directory.

**Step 20:** Run the following sequence:
```bash
cd
mkdir testdir
mkdir testdir/play
```
> *Task:* Recreate the directories again to restore your workspace.

# 🔍 Linux `grep` Command Tutorial & Hands-On Lab

The `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) command is one of the most powerful text-searching tools in Linux. It allows you to search for specific text patterns within files.

---

## 📋 Setup: Creating the Sample File

Before running the practice examples, create a sample text file named `a_file` with the required demonstration lines.

### **Step 1:** Create the file
```bash
touch a_file
```

### **Step 2:** Populate `a_file`
Open `a_file` in `vim` or `nano` and add the following lines:
```text
boot
book
booze
machine
boots
bungie
bark
aardvark
broken$tuff
robots
```

---

## 🛠️ Interactive `grep` Practice Lab

Work through the 15 examples below to learn how different `grep` flags and Regular Expressions (Regex) modify your searches.

> 💡 **Student Tip:** Practice typing these commands directly into your terminal while viewing this file in VS Code!

---

### 1️⃣ Basic Search
Search for any line containing the substring `"boo"`. `grep` loops through every line of `a_file` and prints lines that match.

```bash
grep "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
boot
book
booze
boots
```

---

### 2️⃣ Display Line Numbers (`-n`)
Show line numbers alongside matching outputs.

```bash
grep -n "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
1:boot
2:book
3:booze
5:boots
```

---

### 3️⃣ Invert Match (`-v`)
Display lines that **do not** contain the word `"boo"`.

```bash
grep -v "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
machine
bungie
bark
aardvark
broken$tuff
robots
```

---

### 4️⃣ Combine Inverted Search with Line Numbers (`-vn`)
Display lines that **do not** match `"boo"`, including their original line numbers.

```bash
grep -vn "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
4:machine
6:bungie
7:bark
8:aardvark
9:broken$tuff
10:robots
```

---

### 5️⃣ Count Matches (`-c`)
Count and output only the total number of lines where `"boo"` was found.

```bash
grep -c "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
4
```

---

### 6️⃣ List Matching File Names (`-l`)
Show only the names of files containing matches (searching across all files in the current folder using `*`).

```bash
grep -l "boo" *
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
a_file
```

---

### 7️⃣ Case-Insensitive Search (`-i`)
Turn off case sensitivity so uppercase and lowercase letters match equally.

```bash
grep -i "BOO" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
boot
book
booze
boots
```

---

### 8️⃣ Match Exact Line (`-x`)
Matches whole lines instead of substrings. Since no single line in `a_file` is strictly `"boo"` alone, this produces no output.

```bash
grep -x "boo" a_file
```
**Expected Output:** *(No output)*

---

### 9️⃣ Print Context After Match (`-A`)
Show the matching line plus `2` additional lines that appear immediately **A**fter it (`-A2`).

```bash
grep -A2 "mach" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
machine
boots
bungie
```

---

### 🔟 Match Line Endings (`$`)
Use the regex anchor `$` to match lines that end with the letter `e`.

```bash
grep "e$" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
booze
machine
bungie
```

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Match Line Starts (`^`)
Use the regex anchor `^` to match lines starting with the letter `m`.

```bash
grep "^m" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
machine
```

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Extended Regular Expressions (`-E` OR operator)
Use the `-E` flag to enable Extended Regex. The `|` symbol acts as an **OR** operator (matches `"boot"` OR `"boots"`).

```bash
grep -E "boot|boots" a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
boot
boots
```

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Escape Special Characters (`\`)
Use a backslash `\` to escape special symbols (like `$`) so they are treated as literal characters.

```bash
grep '\$' a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
broken$tuff
```

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Wildcard Character Matching (`.`)
The dot `.` matches any single character. Here `oo..` matches `"oo"` followed by at least two characters.

```bash
grep 'oo..' a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
booze
boots
```

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Zero-or-More Repeats (`*`)
The `*` symbol matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character (`o`). This matches any line containing `o` followed by zero or more `o`s.

```bash
grep 'oo*' a_file
```
**Expected Output:**
```text
boot
book
booze
boots
broken$tuff
robots
```

## 1. Introduction & Fundamentals

### What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a plain text file containing a sequential list of shell commands executed as an automated program by a Unix-like operating system interpreter.

### The Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
The first line of any Bash script must be the **shebang**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
* **Purpose:** Instructs the operating system which command interpreter (e.g., `/bin/bash`) to use to execute the script.
* **Importance:** Omission can lead to execution errors or unexpected behavior if run under a different default shell (such as `/bin/sh` or `/bin/zsh`).

### Creating and Running a Script
1. **Create a file:**
   ```bash
   touch script.sh
   ```
2. **Grant execution permissions (run once):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
3. **Execute the script:**
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

---

## 2. Variables & Data Handling

### Declaring Variables
> **Note:** Linux shell scripting is case-sensitive and strictly space-sensitive. There must be **no spaces** on either side of the `=` assignment operator.

```bash
username="Alice"
age=25
```

By default, Bash treats variable values as text strings.

### Printing Variables
To access the value of a variable, prefix its name with `$`:
```bash
username="Alice"
age=25

echo "My name is $username"
echo "My age is $age"
```
**Output:**
```text
My name is Alice
My age is 25
```

### Variable Concatenation
Use curly braces `${var}` to unambiguously delimit variable names when appending text:
```bash
word="apple"
echo "I ate 3 ${word}s"
```
**Output:**
```text
I ate 3 apples
```

### String Length
To calculate the length of a string, use `${#var_name}` syntax:
```bash
text="Hello World!"
length=${#text}
echo "String Length: $length"
```
**Output:**
```text
String Length: 12
```

### Storing Command Output in Variables
Use command substitution `$(command)` to capture the output of OS commands:
```bash
dir=$(pwd)
echo "Current directory: $dir"
echo "Inline output: $(pwd)"
```
**Output:**
```text
Current directory: /home/seu/Desktop
Inline output: /home/seu/Desktop
```

---

## 3. Arithmetic Operations

Bash natively supports **integer arithmetic**. Decimal/floating-point values are truncated.

### Basic Arithmetic Syntax
```bash
num1=10
num2=3

sum=$(( num1 + num2 ))
dif=$(( num1 - num2 ))
mul=$(( num1 * num2 ))
div=$(( num1 / num2 ))
remainder=$(( num1 % num2 ))

echo "sum: $sum"
echo "dif: $dif"
echo "mul: $mul"
echo "div: $div"
echo "remainder: $remainder"
```
**Output:**
```text
sum: 13
dif: 7
mul: 30
div: 3
remainder: 1
```

### Increment and Decrement Operators
```bash
count=0

(( count++ ))
echo "count: $count"

(( count-- ))
echo "count: $count"

(( count += 5 ))
echo "count: $count"

x=$(( count++ ))
echo "count: $count"
echo "x: $x"

y=$(( ++count ))
echo "count: $count"
echo "y: $y"
```
**Output:**
```text
count: 1
count: 0
count: 5
count: 6
x: 5
count: 7
y: 7
```

---

## 4. User Input & Output

### Printing Output
Use `echo` to print text or variable values to standard output:
```bash
echo "Hello World!"
```
**Output:**
```text
Hello World!
```

### Reading Input
Use the `read` command to capture standard input from the user:
```bash
read username
echo "Hello, $username"
```
**Terminal Interaction:**
```text
Batman
Hello, Batman
```

Use the `-p` prompt flag to display a prompt message before reading input:
```bash
read -p "Enter name: " name
echo "Welcome, $name!"
```
**Terminal Interaction:**
```text
Enter name: Batman
Welcome, Batman!
```

## 5. Conditional Statements & Operators

### Comparison Operators

#### String Comparison
| Operator | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `==` | Equality | `[[ "$a" == "$b" ]]` |
| `!=` | Inequality | `[[ "$a" != "$b" ]]` |
| `-z` | String is empty (zero length) | `[[ -z "$a" ]]` |
| `-n` | String is non-empty (not zero) | `[[ -n "$a" ]]` |

#### Integer Comparison
| Operator | Flag | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `=` | `-eq` | Equal to | `[[ "$a" -eq "$b" ]]` |
| `!=` | `-ne` | Not equal to | `[[ "$a" -ne "$b" ]]` |
| `>` | `-gt` | Greater than | `[[ "$a" -gt "$b" ]]` |
| `>=` | `-ge` | Greater than or equal to | `[[ "$a" -ge "$b" ]]` |
| `<` | `-lt` | Less than | `[[ "$a" -lt "$b" ]]` |
| `<=` | `-le` | Less than or equal to | `[[ "$a" -le "$b" ]]` |

### Conditional Structure Syntax

#### If - Elif - Else
```bash
if [[ condition1 ]]
then
    # execute commands
elif [[ condition2 ]]
then
    # execute commands
else
    # default commands
fi
```

#### Logical Operators
* **AND (`&&`):** Executes if both conditions are true.
  ```bash
  if [[ condition1 ]] && [[ condition2 ]]; then ... fi
  ```
* **OR (`||`):** Executes if either condition is true.
  ```bash
  if [[ condition1 ]] || [[ condition2 ]]; then ... fi
  ```
* **NOT (`!`):** Executes if the condition is false.
  ```bash
  if [[ ! condition ]]; then ... fi
  ```

## 1. Introduction to Threading

### What is a Thread?
A **thread** is the smallest execution unit within a computer program that can be scheduled and managed independently by the operating system CPU scheduler. Multiple threads can exist within a single process, sharing common resources such as memory space, open files, and code segments, while maintaining their own private execution context (registers, program counter, and execution stack).

### Why is Multithreading Needed?
1. **Parallel Execution & Multi-core Utilization:** Modern computer hardware features CPUs with multiple physical cores. Single-threaded applications can only execute on one core at a time, leaving remaining processing power underutilized. Multithreading allows programs to distribute workloads across multiple cores simultaneously.
2. **Improved Responsiveness:** In interactive applications (such as desktop GUIs or web applications), running time-consuming or background operations (e.g., file downloads, database queries) on separate worker threads prevents the main UI thread from freezing.
3. **High Throughput:** Applications processing large datasets or handling simultaneous web client requests (like web servers) achieve significantly higher processing throughput by executing independent tasks concurrently.

### Why is Multithreading Required in Operating Systems?
Operating Systems depend on multithreading for efficient system kernel management and process execution:
* **Efficient Resource Management:** Creating a process requires allocating a distinct virtual memory space, file descriptor tables, and security contexts, which is computationally expensive. Threads share process memory, making thread creation and context switching far cheaper than process-level context switching.
* **Asynchronous I/O Handling:** When a thread performs an input/output operation (e.g., waiting for disk reading or network packets), the operating system can put that specific thread in a waiting state while switching execution to another ready thread, ensuring the CPU remains busy and efficient.
* **Concurrent System Services:** Operating systems use kernel threads to handle concurrent background tasks—such as memory management (garbage collection/paging), hardware interrupt servicing, and file system synchronization—without interrupting user applications.

## 2. Problem 1: Parallel Sum of an Array

### Problem Statement
Divide an array of numbers into two equal halves. Create two threads where **Thread 1** calculates the sum of the first half and **Thread 2** calculates the sum of the second half. The main thread then adds both partial sums together to display the total sum.

### Code Implementation (Array Sum)
```java
class SumTask implements Runnable {
    private final int[] arr;
    private final int start;
    private final int end;
    private int partialSum;

    public SumTask(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    public int getPartialSum() {
        return partialSum;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        partialSum = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            partialSum += arr[i];
        }
    }
}

public class ArraySum {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Total sum = 55
        int mid = numbers.length / 2;

        SumTask task1 = new SumTask(numbers, 0, mid);
        SumTask task2 = new SumTask(numbers, mid, numbers.length);

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task2);

        // Start worker threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Wait for worker threads to complete execution
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        int totalSum = task1.getPartialSum() + task2.getPartialSum();

        System.out.println("Thread 1 Sum: " + task1.getPartialSum());
        System.out.println("Thread 2 Sum: " + task2.getPartialSum());
        System.out.println("Total Array Sum: " + totalSum);
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation (Array Sum)
1. **`SumTask` Implementation (`Runnable` Interface):**
   - The `SumTask` class implements Java's `Runnable` interface, allowing instances to be executed by a thread.
   - It stores references to the shared array (`arr`), processing index limits (`start` and `end`), and a variable to hold the calculated sum (`partialSum`).
   - The `run()` method loops from `start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive) and accumulates the values into `partialSum`.

2. **Array Division & Thread Creation (`main` method):**
   - The main thread creates an integer array of 10 elements and determines the midpoint (`mid = 5`).
   - Two task instances are created: `task1` processes indices `0` to `4` (`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`), and `task2` processes indices `5` to `9` (`{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`).
   - Two `Thread` objects (`t1` and `t2`) are initialized with their respective tasks.

3. **Thread Execution and Synchronization:**
   - `t1.start()` and `t2.start()` invoke the Operating System scheduler to run both threads concurrently.
   - `t1.join()` and `t2.join()` block the execution of the main thread until `t1` and `t2` have finished processing. This prevents the main thread from reading partial sums before calculation completes.
   - Once both threads finish, the main thread reads the partial sums via `getPartialSum()`, adds them together, and prints the results.

### Expected Output
```text
Thread 1 Sum: 15
Thread 2 Sum: 40
Total Array Sum: 55
```

## 3. Problem 2: Parallel Matrix Row Multiplication

### Problem Statement
Given a $3 	imes 3$ matrix and a single scalar value, create 3 separate worker threads where each thread multiplies a single row of the matrix by the scalar value simultaneously.

### Code Implementation (Matrix Scale)
```java
public class MatrixScale {
    private static final int ROWS = 3;
    private static final int COLS = 3;
    private static final int[][] matrix = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };

    static class RowTask implements Runnable {
        private final int rowIndex;
        private final int scalar;

        public RowTask(int rowIndex, int scalar) {
            this.rowIndex = rowIndex;
            this.scalar = scalar;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++) {
                matrix[rowIndex][j] *= scalar;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[ROWS];
        int scalar = 5;

        // Create and start a thread for each row
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(new RowTask(i, scalar));
            threads[i].start();
        }

        // Wait for all threads to complete
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
            threads[i].join();
        }

        // Display the modified matrix result
        System.out.println("Matrix after scalar multiplication (" + scalar + "x):");
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + "	");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation (Matrix Scale)
1. **Shared Memory Structure:**
   - The matrix `matrix` is defined as a `private static final` 2D array accessible to all inner static classes within `MatrixScale`.
   - Because each thread accesses and modifies a completely distinct row index (`matrix[rowIndex]`), no data races or thread contention occur during parallel write operations.

2. **Row Multiplier Task (`RowTask`):**
   - Each `RowTask` instance is instantiated with a specific `rowIndex` and target `scalar` value.
   - Inside `run()`, a single `for` loop iterates across all columns `j` of that assigned row and multiplies each element by `scalar` in-place.

3. **Parallel Dispatch and Synchronization Loop:**
   - An array of `Thread` objects (`threads`) of length equal to `ROWS` (3) is instantiated.
   - A `for` loop instantiates and starts each worker thread (`threads[i].start()`), assigning Thread 0 to Row 0, Thread 1 to Row 1, and Thread 2 to Row 2.
   - A second `for` loop calls `join()` on each thread element to ensure all 3 rows have finished scalar multiplication before the main thread attempts to display the matrix.
   - Finally, the main thread iterates over the matrix and prints the scaled values in tabular format.

### Expected Output
```text
Matrix after scalar multiplication (5x):
5	10	15	
20	25	30	
35	40	45	
```


# Operating System Concepts: CPU Scheduling & Deadlocks

## 1. Introduction to CPU Scheduling Algorithms

CPU Scheduling is a fundamental process by which the operating system decides which process in the ready queue should be allocated to the CPU for execution. The main goal of CPU scheduling algorithms is to maximize CPU utilization, throughput, and minimize waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.

### Key Metrics

* **Arrival Time (AT):** The time at which a process arrives in the ready queue.
* **Burst Time (BT):** The total CPU time required by a process to execute.
* **Completion Time (CT):** The time at which a process finishes execution.
* **Turnaround Time (TAT):** Total time spent from arrival to completion.

$$\mathrm{TAT} = \mathrm{CT} - \mathrm{AT}$$

* **Waiting Time (WT):** Total time spent waiting in the ready queue before getting CPU allocation.

$$\mathrm{WT} = \mathrm{TAT} - \mathrm{BT}$$

---

### How Common CPU Scheduling Algorithms Work

#### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
* **Type:** Non-preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Processes are dispatched in the exact order they arrive in the ready queue (FIFO queue). The process that requests the CPU first gets allocated the CPU first.
* **Pros/Cons:** Simple to understand and implement. However, it can suffer from the **Convoy Effect**, where short processes wait behind long processes, leading to high average waiting times.

#### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
* **Type:** Non-preemptive / Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)
* **Mechanism:** Selects the process with the smallest Burst Time (BT) from the ready queue.
* **Pros/Cons:** Provides the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes. However, predicting the exact CPU burst time in advance is difficult in real operating systems, and long processes can face **starvation**.

#### 3. Priority Scheduling
* **Type:** Preemptive or Non-preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Each process is assigned a priority integer value. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority (e.g., lowest numerical value often represents highest priority).
* **Pros/Cons:** Useful for real-time systems where certain tasks are critical. Major disadvantage is **starvation** (low-priority tasks may wait indefinitely), which can be resolved using **Aging** (gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait for a long time).

#### 4. Round Robin (RR)
* **Type:** Preemptive
* **Mechanism:** Designed for time-sharing systems. Each process is assigned a fixed unit of CPU time called a **Time Quantum** or **Time Slice**. Processes are executed in a cyclic order. If a process does not complete within its assigned quantum, it is preempted and put at the tail of the ready queue.
* **Pros/Cons:** Very responsive and fair. Performance heavily depends on the size of the time quantum—too large acts like FCFS, and too small increases context-switching overhead.

## 2. FCFS Scheduling Algorithm Implementation

Below is a complete C++ implementation of the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Process {
public:
    int pid, at, bt;
    int ct, tat, wt;
    Process(int id, int arrival, int burst) {
        pid = id;
        at = arrival;
        bt = burst;
        ct = 0;
        tat = 0;
        wt = 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    Process p[] = {
        Process(1, 0, 7),
        Process(2, 2, 4),
        Process(3, 4, 1),
        Process(4, 5, 4),
        Process(5, 6, 3)
    };
    int n = 5;

    // Sort processes based on arrival time
    sort(p, p + n, [](Process a, Process b) {
        return a.at < b.at;
    });

    int time = 0;
    float totalWT = 0;
    float totalTAT = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (time < p[i].at)
            time = p[i].at;
        time += p[i].bt;
        p[i].ct = time;
        p[i].tat = p[i].ct - p[i].at;
        p[i].wt = p[i].tat - p[i].bt;
        totalWT += p[i].wt;
        totalTAT += p[i].tat;
    }

    cout << "PID\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "P" << p[i].pid << "\t"
             << p[i].at << "\t"
             << p[i].bt << "\t"
             << p[i].ct << "\t"
             << p[i].tat << "\t"
             << p[i].wt << endl;
    }

    cout << "\nAverage Waiting Time = " << totalWT / n;
    cout << "\nAverage Turnaround Time = " << totalTAT / n << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 3. Introduction to Deadlocks

A **Deadlock** is a situation in a multi-tasking environment where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that is being held by another waiting process.

### Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

A deadlock can occur if and only if all four of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system:

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode (only one process can use the resource at a time).
2. **Hold and Wait:** A process must be currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources that are being held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they can only be released voluntarily after the process completes its task.
4. **Circular Wait:** A closed chain of processes exists such that each process holds one or more resources needed by the next process in the chain.

### How Banker's Algorithm Works

The **Banker's Algorithm** is a deadlock avoidance and detection algorithm named after its analogy to a bank manager serving customers. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation of the maximum declared resources, checking if the system remains in a **Safe State**.

#### Key Matrices and Arrays

* **Allocation Matrix ($n \times m$):** Defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.
* **Max Matrix ($n \times m$):** Defines the maximum demand of each resource by each process.
* **Need Matrix ($n \times m$):** Represents the remaining resource needs of each process.

$$\mathrm{Need}[i][j] = \mathrm{Max}[i][j] - \mathrm{Allocation}[i][j]$$

* **Available Array ($m$):** Vector of length $m$ indicating the number of available resources of each type.

---

## 4. Banker's Algorithm Implementation

Below is the C++ implementation to detect a safe state or deadlock using the Banker's Algorithm.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Process {
public:
    int pid;
    int allocation[3];
    int maxNeed[3];
    int need[3];
    bool finished;
